## Problem 1

To look at the proportion of unsolved homicides in 50 major U.S. cities.

Read data.

``` r
homicide_df =
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Analyzing data.

``` r
aggregate_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
    group_by(city_state) %>% 
    summarize(
      hom_total = n(),
      hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
   )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Trying Prop test for a single city (Baltimore).

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Using iteration to calculate for rest of the cities.

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
    mutate(
      prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
      tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
    ) %>% 
    select(-prop_tests) %>% 
    unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
    select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Graphing resulting dataframe.

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

### Longitudinal study analysis of 10 participants, with 8 weeks of observations.

Read data.

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))
    )
```

tidy the data.

``` r
lda_df = 
   path_df %>% 
  mutate(path = str_replace(path, "\\lda_data/", "")) %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "\\_") %>% 
  mutate(
    id = str_replace(id, "\\.csv", ""),
    arm = replace(arm, arm == "con", "control")
  ) %>% 
  select(id, everything()) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
   pivot_longer(
     week_1:week_8,
     names_to = "week",
     names_prefix = "week_",
     values_to = "obs"
   )

lda_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 160 x 4
    ##    id    arm     week    obs
    ##    <chr> <chr>   <chr> <dbl>
    ##  1 01    control 1      0.2 
    ##  2 01    control 2     -1.31
    ##  3 01    control 3      0.66
    ##  4 01    control 4      1.96
    ##  5 01    control 5      0.23
    ##  6 01    control 6      1.09
    ##  7 01    control 7      0.05
    ##  8 01    control 8      1.94
    ##  9 02    control 1      1.13
    ## 10 02    control 2     -0.88
    ## # ... with 150 more rows

Spaghetti plot

``` r
lda_df %>% 
    ggplot(
      aes(x = week, y = obs, color = arm, group = interaction(arm, id)),
      alpha = 0.3,) +
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle("Observations over time")
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_ps3147_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

The graph indicates that on an average the values of observations were
higher for subjects in the experimental group versus when in the control
group. Also, the average trend in the experimental group showed
increasing observation-values over the 8 weeks time period, versus more
or less consistent values in the control arm.

## Problem 3

To explore power in a simple linear regression, using simulation.

Setting up the t-test function

``` r
sim_mean_p = function(samp_size = 30, mu, sigma = 5) {
  
sim_data = 
  tibble(
      obs = rnorm(n = samp_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  ) 

sim_result = 
  nest(sim_data) %>% 
  mutate(
  t_test = map(.x = data, ~t.test(x = .x, mu = 0, alternative = 'two.sided', paired = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)),
  tidy_test = map(.x = t_test, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) 

return(sim_result)

}
```

Simulating data 5,000 times for each mean, using function

``` r
simulation_results =   
  tibble(
    true_mean = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = true_mean, ~ rerun(50,sim_mean_p(mu = .x))),  
     estimate_df = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
  ) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>%
  unnest(estimate_df)  
```
